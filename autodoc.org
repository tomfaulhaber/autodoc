* Autodoc tasks
** Back to level
*** DONE Merge back to master
*** DONE Standalone autodoc working again
*** DONE Command line option for param-file-driven autodoc building
*** DONE Webhook operational
*** DONE Make sure we can standalone autodoc for 1.2 or 1.3 programs
We should probably use recursive invocation?
*** DONE Update autodoc to a 1.2 base
*** Leiningen support
**** DONE develop strategy for working with Leinigen 1.2
No clojure dependency allowed in plugin
***** Option 1: Just port to 1.2 and drop 1.1 support
I don't thinks this works because standalone requires a clojure dependency 
***** Option 2: Make a lighweight plug-in module separate from autodoc itself
***** Option 3: Don't run as a plugin, but support parsing a project.clj file
** Improved HTML presentation
*** Make version separation clear
**** DONE Define a new branch spec that has real version info in addition to branch name
For instance "(latest stable release)" or "(active development branch)"
**** Fix left-hand TOC to be clearer
***** DONE Add "Other Versions" and move it to the bottom
***** DONE Add a TOC Header that includes the current version
***** DONE Add styling for toc_header class in master toc
***** DONE Add version status
**** DONE Add version info to page header and title
See python docs for a good example

**** TODO Add a blurb for each version to be inserted in the overview file and say what it's about
*** TODO Add categories to clojure.core functions
*** Add pointer back into clojure.core
**** DONE Add pointer back to clojure.org root from the top of the left-hand TOC
**** TODO Make back-pointer a per-project parameter
**** TODO Add pointers to section overview pages for functions (e.g., the Sequences page for instance)
*** TODO Investigate a better way of handling fixed-width fonts 
(browser default, <pre><tt></tt></pre>, see #clojure discussion from 12/27/09)
[[http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2009-12-27.html][IRC Log]]
*** DONE Remove, improve namespace level usage message.
*** TODO Add "last updated", git version info
But figure out how to do this without gratuitous page changes
*** TODO Make sub-namespace presentation better
*** TODO Mark deprecated fns, namespaces wherever they are mentioned 
by italics, maybe
** Clean up HTML
*** TODO Use Linkchecker and remove all dead links
*** TODO Use "Dust Me selectors plugin" and clean up CSS based on results
*** TODO Think through ids vs. classes
** Improved 1.2 Support
*** DONE Document protocols and figure out how to link their methods back to them
incanter.distribution.Distribution might be a good one to use for testing
& clojure.data.finger-tree
** Improved 1.3 support
*** TODO Add a notation for dynamic
*** TODO Can we get type annotations?
*** TODO Support docstrings for special forms
** Complete the gh-pages doc
*** TODO Figure out missing sections
*** TODO add layout/style to gh-pages doc 
(look at http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/configuration  for examples)
*** TODO include pygments style in gh-doc 
(see http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/blob/master/css/syntax.css)
** New features
*** Image support
**** TODO Figure out how to do image support for Incanter
*** Maven task
**** TODO Build a Maven taks for autodoc
*** Search support
**** TODO Figure out how search support should work
** TODO Deprecate pages at richhickey.github.com
** Support for clojuredocs
*** DONE Add index.clj files to all projects
*** DONE Extend index data to include all metadata information
*** DONE Add raw file pointers so Zack can pull the source/refs
*** DONE Build the code to pull source and symbols
** Maven support
*** DONE version from pom.xml
*** DONE Figure out how to get dependencies from maven
*** TODO Get dependencies and versions from the pom.xml
Current idea: 
1. Depend on leiningen
2. (:use [leiningen.deps :only [find-jars]])
3. (find-jars {:local-repo-classpath true, :dependencies ...}) where the dependencies look like project.clj
4. the answer should be a list of files to add to our classpath. Yay!

Q: Do I need to do more setup to get maven to work right or will that be done for me implicitly?
** Bugs
*** DONE Supplementary docs master TOC doesn't work
We need to add the appropriate ../.. stuff to the links on the master TOC
*** TODO Autodoc doesn't work on windows
This appears to be a pathname thing / vs. \
*** DONE Clean up "only used with ant-wrapper" params in params.clj
*** TODO Make the param-dir option in autodoc.clj better integrated with the rest
*** DONE Remove all refs to contrib
*** TODO Figure out why Condition/-init doesn't seem to generate an index entry
Is this still a bug?
*** DONE Fix url detection so that it always works
*** DONE Supress author tag when none provided
*** TODO Make &emdash; work in headers and titles
Enlive seems to not escape this correctly (probably it's just tag soup underneath)
*** DONE Fix "no project specified" at the top of the API index page!
*** DONE Make the sub-namespace links on a namespace right hand TOC work
*** DONE Get source links working right again
*** TODO Get non-master updates to trigger auto builds
*** TODO Fix left-TOC on ie (ul styling on first category)
*** DONE Fix modular contrib docs
*** TODO Add version number info to wrapped markdown files
*** DONE Some source link (see clojure.contrib.accumulators/add) don't seem to be working right.
*** DONE Fix source links in incanter
*** TODO Add a README in the target
