Autodoc is a program which generates API documentation in HTML
from Clojure source code. It can be run
as a standalone application or from a build system such as ant or leiningen.

Complete documentation is available at
[https://tomfaulhaber.github.io/autodoc](https://tomfaulhaber.github.io/autodoc).

Autodoc is used to generate the documentation for
[Clojure](https://clojure.github.io/clojure) itself,
Clojure contrib projects,
and [Incanter](https://liebke.github.com/incanter).

I run it on Ubuntu. I expect it would work fine on any Unix, but probably would have 
some glitches on Windows.

Dependencies: ant, ant-optional, enlive, clojure-contrib

Autodoc is being developed by Tom Faulhaber (to mail me you can use
